### Hey there, I'm Riccardo!

I am about to graduate ðŸŽ“ with the Master of Applied Data Science (MADS) from the University of Michigan School of Information (UMSI). I have a graduate and PhD in management and engineering from Polytechnic University of Turin (Italy). I've got 5 years of experience in management and data science focusing on Python, SQL, and Qlik Sense. I am skilled at translating business needs into functional requirements, building SQL and Spark pipelines, using Python to explore and clean data, and developing dashboards using Qlik Sense.

My most recent, open source projects are:

1) ðŸ“£ [Propaganda Analysis](https://github.com/Rick0701/Propaganda-analysis) is my MADS Milestone I project. Analyzed in *python* how Russian propaganda towards Ukraine originated, propagated, evolved and its effectiveness by scraping and analyzing the most popular Russian TV news broadcast. I worked on a team of two for two months to scrape, clean, and analyze data in *Pandas* and visualize with *matplotlib* and *Vega-Altair*.
2) ðŸŽ® [Videogames Reccommendation](https://github.com/Rick0701/Videogames_Reccomendation) is my MADS Milestone II project. I worked on a team of three on a STEAM dataset retrieved from Kaggle. Analyzed in python using deep learning (using Keras) which games to reccommend to gamers.
